# PharseLearner

I had a really hard time using other software for learning languages due to being so bad at spelling that I would spell the answer wrong so I made this program which uses edit distance to ignore minor spelling mistakes for given phrases. 

## Running 
I have only tested with korean and you can refer to ``phrasesExample.json``` for how to format the phrase file.

Just run ```./startup.py``` and note you terminal will need to support utf-8.
